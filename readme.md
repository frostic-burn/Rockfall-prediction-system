AI-Based Rockfall Prediction and Alert System

This project integrates multi-sensor monitoring (Slope Radar, GNSS, Tilt Nodes, Piezometers, Impact Sensors, Weather Stations, and Cameras) with an AI-driven cloud platform to predict and detect rockfall events in open-pit mines.
Data from distributed sensors is preprocessed at the edge, securely transmitted via IoT gateways, and fused in real time by ML models (XGBoost + deep learning). The system generates risk heatmaps, issues early warnings, and triggers standard operating procedures (SOPs) for mine safety.
This ensures life protection, operational continuity, and cost savings while promoting sustainable and safer mining operations.
